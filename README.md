# IPv4 Subnetting Question Generator

## What is the Purpose of this Program?
I wrote this command-line tool to give myself an decent alternative for practicing my subnetting for an upcoming networking certification.

## Who is this Tool for?
This is for anyone who wants to keep their subnetting skills sharp, or anyone who is studying for a networking exam.

## How Does this Tool Help with Subnetting? 
This tool generates a random class A, B, or C IP address utilizing the built-in random methods that Python provides. It will take that IP address and calculate the important figures needed to calculate a subnet in manually (network address, broadcast address, address block size, interesting octet, etc.). It then uses that data and inputs it into questions that are often asked during networking exams. For example you may be asked to find the network/broadcast address of a given network or its range of valid host addresses. That is just one of the many question formats that are asked.

Feel free to take this tool if it could be of some use to you!
